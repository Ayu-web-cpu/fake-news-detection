# üì∞ Fake News Detection using NLP and Machine Learning

This project is a machine learning-based system to detect fake news using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. It classifies news articles as **REAL** or **FAKE** using a trained Passive Aggressive Classifier.

## üöÄ Features

- Fake and real news classification using NLP
- TF-IDF Vectorization for text preprocessing
- Passive Aggressive and SVM classifiers
- Streamlit web app for interactive predictions
- Easy deployment-ready model

---

## üìÅ Dataset

- `Fake.csv` from [Kaggle Fake News Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/clmentbisaillon/fake-and-real-news-dataset)
- A synthetic "real news" dataset is generated to balance the data (can be replaced with `True.csv` for production use)

---

## üß† Model

- **TF-IDF** for converting text to features
- **Passive Aggressive Classifier** for training
- Accuracy over 90% on test data
